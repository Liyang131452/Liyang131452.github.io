# Introduction

## About me

&emsp;&emsp;I graduated from Nanjing Normal University in 2023, and now I am working in a leading automobile company in the industry. Engaged in research and development related positions, more familiar with C/C++/Java and other development languages, currently mainly using Java language. In addition to the above things, I am also learning front-end related work, such as: this Blog. I only know a little about the front end (PS: sitting through a JavaWeb course should count).Maybe I didn't want to put too much effort into the front end, so I used some of the existing tools on the front-end: JEKYLL. (Why not use tools?)

I look forward to your communication on technology.

Please send me an email if you need anything.
